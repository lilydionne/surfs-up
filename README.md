# Surfs Up: Investing In Waves & Ice Cream

## Overview
In this analysis, we were tasked to calculate temperature statistics for June and December to see if running a surf shop is sustainable year around. In order to get this information, we need to run two seperate queries for the months of June and December. After complteling our queries, we can store the temperature data in a list, convert them into a dataframe, and perform statiscial analysis. To create our summary statistics, we will use the .describe() method.
